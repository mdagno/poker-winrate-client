##Description
Poker WinRate is an interactive web application that allows users to track results after each poker session to determine their win rate over time. As much as poker is a game of skill, luck is a huge element of the game and it is important to track results to determine a playerâ€™s edge over a long period of time. This application allows users to input their sessions indicating the game type, buy-in amount, and how much they cashed out. The results are then compiled and sorted, and users are provided a data visualization in the analytics section.
